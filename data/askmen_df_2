Hello my fellow men,

I'm in search of a piece of advice or just anything that might help me make a decision, probably from the more experienced part of this community. I'm having some difficulties with making a good decision regarding the future of my professional career so I thought I could turn to you guys.

Some background:   
I'm 26 years old and have been working as a procurement consultant for 3 years. The client is a large chemical company where I'm part of the EMEA sourcing team. I've always wanted to be a consultant and enter the corporate world, which wasn't easy. I have a Master's degree in Criminological Sciences (wasn't the best student in my day, it was tough but I made it nonetheless) and I hoped that the degree would open the doors to consultancy. At first it didn't, but my current employer decided to hire me anyway and things have been good until a few weeks ago. 

I've been given positive feedback by the client time and time again. I've proven myself over and over to be a good employee but this didn't reflect itself in my salary review. It seems they don't really care about me and they just want me to remain billable. During a call with my manager at the client I found out that I should/could be making 20 k€ more annually and he advised to revise my plans for the future. My ambitions are to reach middle management and keep my options open for a higher position if I'd wish to in the future. The thing is, I don't have an economical background.

How big is the impact of a master's degree in economics when your career is already advanced? Do I combine study with work now that I'm still young (will be tough and idk if it is feasible) or doesn't this have any added value? I'm just scared that I'll remain stuck somewhere at the bottom until my retirement because I don't have the necessary qualifications on paper. 

Would you guys advise to just keep gaining experience and doing a good job or would you go back to studying to open up other opportunities with other employers and possibly having a shot at achieving my goals for the future?


Any feedback is massively welcome!

My little brother totally went out of character and did something very irresponsible due to wanting (cheap) female attention. The family has been worried. Wonder how you guys overcome this? Any advice for him? Many thanks for your time!

A rundown of events without any subjective commentary:
- My brother is 26 years old, spends more time with computers than humans. Has never dated. The closest was going to a party with a girl. Hasn’t done anything more than holding hands. 
- Around late December the family was in Mexico City, planning to go to Cancún for Christmas and New Year’s.
- We had all been very careful with the COVID situation. We always wear masks when going out, limit contact with strangers, and stay inside our Airbnb 90% of the time.
- We were also aware that we were in a foreign country. We barely went out after dark.
- One day, brother said he met a Mexican girl on Tinder and was going for an afternoon coffee date the next day. We were all happy for him.
- The next day he left for coffee around 4pm.
- At 6pm he said he’d dine with the girl and her friends. Will be back after dinner.
- At 9pm he sent a pic of himself with two girls and one guy in a bar/restaurant WITHOUT masks. The two girls wore a lot of makeup and revealing clothing. There were beer bottles on the table. We were slightly concerned but he appeared sober and promised to be home around 10pm.
- At 10pm he said he’s going to his date’s home to “drink on the balcony”. We weren’t very comfortable. We asked him questions that can only be answered when he’s sober and has free will, made him send us the girl’s home address and start location sharing. He said he’d be home around midnight.
- Around midnight he said he’s not coming home tonight. We were all shocked. But nothing we could do other than verifying the girls address and ask him to use protection.
- He came home safe and sound the next morning (thank goodness). Saying he had fun because that was the first time a girl had agreed to meet him. They danced on the balcony all night. He enjoyed spending time with her because “she liked him a lot”. Even though she doesn’t speak English and he doesn’t speak Spanish. 
- He admitted not wearing a mask while dining and dancing (none of his date’s friends did either). Given that his aunt just completed a surgery 2 weeks ago and was still recovering (he’s fully aware. As a matter of fact he’s close to his aunt and had been prioritizing time to care for her), we decided we should all start wearing masks even when at home and he should stay away from aunt. 
- He continued talking to this girl for several days. One night he left home at 9pm to see her and unplanningly spent the night again (no one else in the family ever left home after dark).
- Some time before Christmas (and one week after meeting this girl) he said he wouldn’t be joining us in Cancun. He would spend the holidays with this girl in Mexico City. He will book his own Airbnb. 
- We wondered how good was the connection and/or the sex. Somehow the only reasoning he mentioned was she liked him, she wanted to spend time with him, she taught him dancing. There were no words of how much he liked her, how they overcame the language barrier and made a connection, how good was the sex, etc.

I think the above is all the relevant information. For closure - they broke up before Christmas and he ended up joining the family in Cancun (surprise!) Contrary to our belief that he was deeply in love with the girl, he wasn’t. He said there were a lot of differences between them; he wasn’t going for sex and didn’t have sex. so it turns out he was just in love with the attention she gave him. And such attention was sufficient to turn him into a selfish, crazy, and irresponsible person we’d never know. 

Later he was very apologetic to the family, but he kept emphasizing that was the first time a girl was “interested enough to meet him”. We understand his pain, but we don’t think he saw the real problem. Nothing wrong with going to see a girl; but the reason for seeing the girl (she agreed to meet him, she gave him attention) is horrible. Dating is not about receiving attention. Totally losing character not for love but for attention is both astonishing and pathetic. 

He mentioned he may do some affordable traveling in third world countries. Is it a good idea for him to meet more foreign girls via Tinder? We think it can be dangerous if he accepts anything from any girl who shows interest in him. If he doesn’t travel how can we help him overcome such desperation for attention and start healthy dating in the US? He needs a girlfriend but we want him to do so in a safe, healthy way.

There’s many weird factors involved like I’m way in my late 30’s and he’s in his early 20’s. I’m very sexually experienced and he’s not (I’m only his second partner). He’s not the smash and dash hook up type in the slightest. We are both single af and aren’t having sex with other people. It just kind of happened, the sex was fun and I was impressed despite us being sloppy drunk. We both initiated it, but he was far less drunk then me. I had thought about him sexually soberly many times before anything ever happened. 
We talked the next day over text. He was mature and wanted to make sure things wouldn’t be weird between us. We both agreed that we aren’t spreading the news of our hook up around. I saw him briefly yesterday and honestly, he was a little weird and barely made eye contact with me. I texted him a little while later and asked if he was okay. It took him a while to respond, but it was business as usual and just friendly whatever texts. I made no moves and wasn’t flirty at all.
Here’s the problem, I would be interested in having a sexual relationship with him. I’m not looking for a boyfriend or have weird expectations of anything. I just want a FWB with emphasis on the friend part and could use some general NSA sex. I have no idea where his head is at with all. He told told me that he really enjoyed the experience with me though and I know he liked it. He’s fairly nerdy, so I think even if he was interested in hooking up again, he’d have no idea how to approach me and as the older one, I think I would need to take the lead. 
I don’t know what my next move should be. Do I just leave it all alone and just be chill as his friend? I’m a really forward person, so I just want to be like hey, what’s up, wanna come over and fuck around? Would that flatter a guy or freak him out? Help!

He said some of very mean stuff to me basically not being himself. At that point it took a toll on me and i went into panic mode to see him reacting that way and went on begging and pleading him. But he shut me off and want some time apart. Which i hesitantly agree. 

He reached out 1 month later telling me he’s feeling better. But I was still hurt by him. So naturally my responds were a bit cold to him. I cant pretend to be ok when i’m not. But then he saw me that way, and he went distant again. 

I love this man and he’s a good guy but I haven’t seen this side of him in our 2 years together. I genuinely believe we could work things out. But its hard for me to communicate to him if he keeps avoiding me all the time when I try to talk to him. My patience is running thin. 

Please be kind and dont tell me to break up. That is another issue i will think about. My question is how to handle dismissive avoidant men when in relationship conflict?

I'm in search of a piece of advice or just anything that might help me make a decision, probably from the more experienced part of this community. I'm having some difficulties with making a good decision regarding the future of my professional career so I thought I could turn to you guys.

Some background:   
I'm 26 years old and have been working as a procurement consultant for 3 years. The client is a large chemical company where I'm part of the EMEA sourcing team. I've always wanted to be a consultant and enter the corporate world, which wasn't easy. I have a Master's degree in Criminological Sciences (wasn't the best student in my day, it was tough but I made it nonetheless) and I hoped that the degree would open the doors to consultancy. At first it didn't, but my current employer decided to hire me anyway and things have been good until a few weeks ago. 

I've been given positive feedback by the client time and time again. I've proven myself over and over to be a good employee but this didn't reflect itself in my salary review. It seems they don't really care about me and they just want me to remain billable. During a call with my manager at the client I found out that I should/could be making 20 k€ more annually and he advised to revise my plans for the future. My ambitions are to reach middle management and keep my options open for a higher position if I'd wish to in the future. The thing is, I don't have an economical background.

How big is the impact of a master's degree in economics when your career is already advanced? Do I combine study with work now that I'm still young (will be tough and idk if it is feasible) or doesn't this have any added value? I'm just scared that I'll remain stuck somewhere at the bottom until my retirement because I don't have the necessary qualifications on paper. 

Would you guys advise to just keep gaining experience and doing a good job or would you go back to studying to open up other opportunities with other employers and possibly having a shot at achieving my goals for the future?

&amp;#x200B;

Any feedback is massively welcome!

Some depressed time later i met that new girl (she even uses reddit!!) and we got together a few weeks later. She is that girl and I always have a great time with her and I've been with her for 4+ months. 
Kind of important fact: She lives in Spain and I live in Germany.
But from time to time I think about my ex gf and sometimes even missing her in some way. She even texted me and said that she kinda misses me, but I rejected her because she broke my heart. It feels weird..
