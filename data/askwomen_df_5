Now in my experience whenever a woman shows interest in me I have reciprocated the same interest but a few days after I do, they start to become cold or distant and completely shut down. I end up chasing the woman after she starts loosing attraction for me. Some women have told me that I was needy when I showed interest in her. I personally dont think I came off as needy, I may have texted a bit more than usual but thats because I like this person, and I dont want to treat them as just a friend. Or I bought a rose when I was in the mood because I wanted to make her feel good that day. Apparently these were desperate acts.

With women who I've had an interest for but decided to restrain it and just show little to no interest they continue to pursue and chase me. I didnt reciprocate to much interest in them and they continued to chase me. In those situations I actually ended up with 3 women who were attracted to me and for once in my life I was the one who was able to choose the woman I wanted to be with.

Each of these men are really attracted to a woman in their life and each woman has started developing an attraction to each of these men. Each of these men know that the woman is starting to like them more and more and they want to build on that attraction, but they know that a lot of women will be turned off if they show too much interest

&amp;#x200B;

Cade is a man with high confidence, good looks, and a genuinely good person. Helping others when he can, checking up on his friends, and he is fun to be around, he takes part in some interesting hobbies such as art, and is a sucker for pop culture. The only problem is he has very little experience with women, whenever he is in a possible relationship with a woman, he is usually the one doing the chasing and this woman is one of the first to show her interest in him, so naturally he is really excited and doesnt want to lose her, so he shows more interest in her in hopes that she will  feel special. He is still a young man entering his mid twenties, and growing up his parents always taught him to treat the women he likes as special to him, sometimes to go above and beyond for these women to show them that they are special to him. He does this by texting her everyday, not every minute of the day of course, but a bit too often throughout the day. He tries to strike up conversation once every lets say 3-4 hours and while he is successful at keeping her interested in conversations he gets anxious that she will lose interest as he starts to run out of topics to talk about. Or on days when he isn't texting her that often, the texts he does send contain information showing how attracted he is to her, sending a good morning text with a heart emoji, or checking up on her when he hadn't texted her all day. And in person he's always doing his best to be as close to her as possible, walking alongside her, and if they are with friends always making sure he is sitting next to her. If you were in this woman's position would you have lost interest in Cade?

&amp;#x200B;

Eren is a much more experienced man albeit the same age as Cade, he and Cade are similar in that they both have good looks, fun to be around, are actually interesting people, and they both have extremely strong feelings to the women they are attracted to. The only difference is, Eren has learned that when he shows little to no interest in a woman, they end up chasing him. So he continues this with promising results but he takes it to the extreme. Whenever a woman texts him, he sees the message and gets back to it much later than he should , out of thought that he would look desperate texting back as soon as she texts him, for him it would be too easy to text back as soon as she texts him because he always has his phone on him. He acts cold and mysterious around women he's interested in and this usually gets him the results he is looking for. He has the ""abundance mindset"" in that the woman he likes isn't the only woman he talks to, he flirts with other women in case she doesnt have a mutual interest in him. His conversations with the woman he is interested, though not as often as he'd like over text message are still interesting and enticing, and because he doesnt text the woman he likes as often, they have more fun and interesting conversations both in text and in person. The only problem Eren faces is that it hurts him to act this way because he is genuinely a loving and caring person and doesnt like to hold back when it comes to loving someone, but because of a past experience with a lover, he fears that if he shows too much interest she will lose her attraction and interest in him, he will fear having to be the one chasing all the time as he did when he was younger. So he keeps this up, and though it hurts a little, most of the time its worth it for him when he and his woman are in intimate moments and he is able to tell her ""I really enjoy spending time with you"" or ""My days are always brighter than usual with you"". Saying these feel like a 100 ton weight was lifted off his chest. If you were the woman of Erens interest, would you lose attraction or still be interested in him?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Rin, a man of the same age as Eren and Cade. He has their good looks, interesting personalities, and strong feelings towards a woman. Rin has had a little bit of experience with women and has learned that when he shows interest but not too much, he is able to keep the girl he loves interested in him until they become exclusive. Rin shows eagerness like Cade but has learned how to restrain it to show he isn't desperate like Eren. Like Cade he texts the woman he likes almost everyday, but not every 2-3 hours, rather once a day asking them how their day was, telling jokes or funny stories, or flirting over text, but he keeps it to one to two text conversations a day and nothing more, sometimes less when he isn't feeling good. He shows eagerness by staying as close to her as possible when they are together in person, but dials it back such as when they are with friends, if she is sitting on the opposite end of the table, he doesnt try to get up and switch seats just to be closer to her. Like Eren he shows restraint but not too much, sometimes if she texts him, he sees the message and gets back to her a little later, unlike Eren he doesnt do this consistently. Like Eren he sometimes acts mysterious, such as leaving the woman guessing when she wants to know more about him. Unlike Eren he doesnt leave her guessing forever and lets her in some more. Like Cade he does chase the woman he likes a lot, but unlike Cade and like Eren, he restrains it if she doesnt show the same amount of interest and only starts reciprocating again when she starts chasing him. If you were the woman of Rin's interest, would you lose attraction to him?

&amp;#x200B;

I know these are weird examples but these are what came off of my head after what I've read from the experiences of men when it came to attracting women. Sorry for the long read but based on what I've said: Do you find it attractive when a man is able to restrain his eagerness and interest in you?

I had an appointment for this evening to finally get one inserted after months of waiting, phone calls, arguing with insurance representatives, and dealing with the hormonal changes that accompany a birth control change (my previous one expired after 3 years and was removed 4 months ago), and the clinic just called to reschedule my appointment. 

And... I'm angry. Why is this so hard? Why isn't my health or well-being a priority for these people? I'm angry at the healthcare system of this country, at these clinics for not doing their due diligence, at the providers for not being successful in their attempts to insert (I almost got it inserted at the previous appointment, but the NP was not comfortable working with my body type and did not have an ultrasound), and I'm angry at men. 

I have dealt with our failing healthcare system in the past, so while this is a painful and raw experience it is not new and I know I will overcome this feeling. The anger at men is new, however, and I am having trouble placing it. 

Men don't have to deal with the pain, discomfort, or irritation of working with and manipulating hormones to prevent pregnancy. The burden of maintaining contraception falls on women's shoulders, and I feel sick with the injustice of it.
