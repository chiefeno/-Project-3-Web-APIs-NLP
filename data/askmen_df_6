In my corporate job there is no ""backup"" as a manager.  I can't call-in last minute as there are many meetings to be run, people to talk to, plans and decisions to be made, etc.

I was almost in tears during a few discussions and its not even lunch time.  I made some mistakes which I was called out for, fair enough and I own those but it still feels bad to let others down.  Then it just kept going... people digging in more and me feeling like I don't even belong here in the least, that I'm not helping only making things worse.

I don't have the energy to set a few things straight where other people have contributed to the problems and even if I did, it comes off as making excuses.

I want to shut my laptop off and just be done for the day but that won't solve anything. 

People can tell im upset but I have to carry on.

Even my wife asked if I was ok... I told her no but I have no choice and need to just suck it up and stop complaining.

A little back story, due to COVID and loss of wages from being a restaurant worker, I had to break my lease and move back home which obviously isn't what I'd call ideal. But, shit happens and it is what it is. To break my lease I obviously had to speak with management of the apartment complex and find out what that meant. Manager is new by the way. What it came down to was basically paying 2 months worth of rent as a fee. Okay, fine. My next questions is when do I pay it? My first response from the apartment manager was to pay when I actually signed the lease break documents. When I come to do that, I am then told that the fee could be paid anytime before I actually turn in keys. I'm a couple months out from actually turning in keys at this point so I decide to wait till closer to the date to pay because it's expensive. It gets closer to the date of moving out, I'm ready to pay, and I email the office because the fee has never been added to our online payment portal so I can't pay. I am then told by the manager that once we turn in keys, it will be added and then I can pay. So, January 16th rolls around, we move out and turn in keys. I go to look and pay the bill and I can't pay because what the manager didn't inform us was that you are removed from the system once you finally move out..... okay, so how should I pay? Well, they will mail the bill and then I can just mail a check to them. So, come Jan. 26th, I get the final bill in the mail (Saturday). Yesterday rolls around (Tuesday), I haven't mailed the check yet because it's been 2 business days and I've been busy and I start getting calls from a collection agency.

This collection agency, IQ Data International, has to be one of the biggest piece of shit company with the most piece of shit people ever. I assume there is some mistake because it's been 3 fucking days since I got the final bill in the mail and I explain this to IQ Data and let's call the person ""Paul"". The asshole Paul doesn't care about this, is extremely rude, threatens damage to my credit and puts on his high pressure, predatory practices of making me pay right now without even providing me proof yet that they have the bill. After a lot of argument I tell him I'm not paying until I have some time to discuss with the apartment complex on why they have the bill and to make sure everything is okay there. I then speak with the apartment again and am told by apparently incompetent's manager that IQ Data isn't even the company they use anymore for debt collections. So, now I'm definitely not paying them until I know more. I call IQ Data back and let them know that the apartment complex stated they don't even use them anymore. Paul decides to elevate me to his Operations Manager, let's call him ""Randy"". Before I even get on the phone with Randy I receive an email from him with the actual bill from collections stating the have it. Cool. I'm not disputing that. Randy gets on the phone and before I can say a word, raises his voice and basically yells, ""what do you want from me, you can call my bluff and I'll just throw this on your credit report right now, blah, blah, blah, I get off on yelling at random strangers (last part may not have actually been said)."" I lose my cool because I'm being yelled at by a complete stranger, I call the guy a fucking dick and hang up on him. This all happens between about 5-6pm so of course everyone is trying to leave their office jobs so it makes it more difficult to find anything out. The corporate office is suppose to be contacted to find out more about what is going on and I am left in waiting hoping that I don't get a delinquency on my credit report from shithole IQ Data, fucking asshat Paul, and his fuckstick boss Randy because they are unwilling to let me have a day or two to do my due diligence and figure out why the fuck a bill went to collections after 3 days.

So, all of that to ask, men who work in collections, how big of a piece of shit are you and how small is your dick to where you have to yell at random strangers, make them feel terrible, and use predatory practices on people that most likely are in a very tough situation?

Also, if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this and if it does end up on my credit, what can I do to get it removed since this seems a bit extreme?

TLDR: A bill got sent to collections after 3 days (yes 3 days) after being misinformed by the apartment complex manager about when/how to pay the bill.

 But sometimes I am not in that mode, and I want more of a proper, nice conversation, a warmer tone so to speak, and not being constantly interrupted with sarcastic remarks when Im trying to tell a story or just talk friendly. Sometimes I don't want to be told how much I suck at a game, over and over, when I really try my best(other times is just fun and teasing and he calls me cute and we get horny lol)But when I try to tell him this, if I find his comments hurtful or too much, he tells me to suck it up and gets mad at me for ""not understanding that he is not trying to hurt me"". I do understand he is not trying to hurt me on purpose, but that doesnt mean it can't feel bad sometimes. 

Why is it so hard to adjust a little, to ""read the room"", listen when the audience doesnt laugh? Or at least validate what I feel when I say so? Am I the one that should feel guilty for ""hurting him by saying it hurts me"", and should I be the one adjusting and accepting because it's just the way he is, and that he wants to be able to say whatever he wants as long as he doesnt mean anything bad by it?

The thing is, everything is going on in  private chat when we bump each other at work. We could talk for a while  and not get bored. I like her and i've told her a bunch of times she's  pretty.

But  she seems very weird around colleagues, she almost never speaks to me  around them, acts like i don't exist. Ignores me when i say hi or in a  group never reacts on what i say or reply or looks at me. She  immediately purposely tries to intensify the chat with the other  colleague if i join in. And this happens all the time.

This  strange behaviour reminds me of a primitive childhood colleague  situation when a girl from school did this, and i've found out later  they were all hating me and discussing me on my back after some strange  bullying events. This sounds pathological in the current situation, as  we are not children.

The  thing is, I'm at a point where i've passed the small talk and i've told  her in her face i like her and i want more but she doesn't take me  serious because i'm 10 years younger, always trying to act busy or  changing the subject. I asked her out once and she said something like  'who knows what people will think around here' (the rest of the  colleagues).

Maybe she is ashamed of her age (40) being single and not courted by men her own age?
